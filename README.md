## Problem Statement and Opportunity
Colorado corn producers have long recognized the need to utilize practices that benefit both economic and environmental sustainability.  In fact, many Colorado corn growers are already using a diverse set of practices that better match the nutrient needs of the crop, reduce environmental impacts, and increase profitability.

Irrigation and intensive rainfall events can cause surface runoff and deep leaching from agricultural fields resulting in loss of valuable nutrients, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Non-point sources of pollution like these are being considered as the State of Colorado begins to implement nutrient criteria (Regulation 85) for surface water in addition to continued monitoring of nutrients and pesticides in groundwater. 

One best management practice (BMP) for reducing nutrient and sediment loss in surface runoff is the use of vegetative filter/buffer strips (NRCS Conservation Practices Standard no. 393). These are areas of perennial vegetation, planted at the edge of an agricultural field, which can help remove nutrients and sediment from tail water. Filter strips are designed to move runoff water across the strip, filtering sediment and nutrients before the water leaves a field. Potential benefits of VFSs include: reduction of sediment and nutrients and E coli in runoff, improving water quality and potentially increasing soil health.

Although there is a body of research on the effectiveness of filter strips in agronomic systems in the midwest, a lack of information is available in the Intermountain West. Additionally, little research has been done to investigate the potential for pollinator habitats in filter strips. More than 30 percent of our food relies on insect pollination, mainly bee species. The annual value of crops pollinated by wild, native bees in the United States is estimated at $3 billion. Recent research has shown that wild native bees, which number more than 4,000 species in North America, contribute substantially to crop pollination on farms where their habitat needs are met (USDA Biology Technical Note No.  78, 3rd Ed.). As such, it is increasingly important that farmers implement practices to promote habitat for these crucial pollinators.

This pilot project will seek to create a pollinator habitat in an existing filter strip located near Fort Collins, Colorado on a surface irrigated grain corn field. The primary project goal is to investigate the potential of establishing pollinator species in an existing filter strip, and measure the impact it has on the nutrient and sediment removal capacity of the filter strip.

## Approach
### Study Site: CSU ARDEC
An existing filter strip, approximately 0.25 acres in size, was established at the tail edge of a 5.5 acre field at CSU’s Agricultural Research, Development and Education Center (ARDEC) in 2020 and contained meadow brome and orchardgrass (Figure 1). This filter strip significantly reduced significant issues with sediment runoff, and nutrients. The crop rotation for the study field is corn, pinto beans and winter wheat. The field is furrow irrigated utilizing gated pipe and well water. In 2022, the field will be planted to grain corn utilizing appropriate fertilizer BMPs. 

### Experimental Method: Establishing Pollinator Species
For this research study, our team will add known species of pollinator plants to the established filter strip. The team will select a variety of early, mid, and late season pollinator species as noted in CSU Extension Fact Sheet 5.616. Planting the pollinators will occur in early spring (March-April) after a significant rain event and will involve mowing a portion of the filter strip to reduce plant competition for better establishment.  The newly planted filter strip may need to be irrigated artificially before the first corn irrigation.  If so, this will be accomplished by bringing stock tanks full of water to flood irrigate the strip.

### Experimental Method: Field Sample Collection
Our research team has already installed automated water sampling devices both upstream and downstream of the existing filter strip to measure important water quality parameters (including; Nitrate, Phosphorus, Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen, sediment, OrthoPhosphate, and Total Phosphorous), and thus the effectiveness of the filter strip to reduce the concentration and load of the analytes listed above. Each device consists of a flume to measure water flow, A Teledyne ISCO 6712 portable water sampler, a bubbler to measure water depth, a cellular modem, and a solar-powered battery. During irrigation events, these automated samplers will collect 200 mL water each hour. During storm events, it will sample based on intensity at 200 mL of water per 250 gal of water through the flume.

Our team will take pre, mid, and postseason soil samples in multiple, representative locations from 0-8” depths both in the corn field and the filter strip. These samples will be processed for routine soil fertility. Additionally, we will take postseason deep soil samples (5’ deep) to analyze for potential nitrate leaching and loss below the corn root zone.

### Experimental Method: Data Analysis
Data collected during the season will be used to determine the ability of the filter strip to remove pollutants and converted to an efficiency percentage in order to compare the new pollinator filter strip to previous years.


Removal Efficiency % =  (Upstream Analyte Concentration (ppm or lbs.))/(Downstream Analyte Concentration (ppm or lbs.))×100

## Results
The primary outcome of this project would be an increased understanding of how filter strips can reduce agricultural nonpoint source pollution while providing pollinator habitat in Colorado corn production. Although many nutrient loss pathways are well understood, it is widely recognized that agriculture needs more data to show what it is doing to reduce environmental losses. These results will be utilized to develop and improve recommendations and models that are utilized for decision making related to potential nutrient loads. Additionally, this project could provide a way to merge two best management practices into one, offering a more environmentally and economically sustainable option for farmers. 

More coming!
